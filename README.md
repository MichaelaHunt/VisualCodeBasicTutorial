## How to navigate to Source Control:
Use the side panel nav - click the circled icon.

This is what it looks like and important spots to take note of:

## How to create a new branch

Note that the "active branch" view at the bottom has changed!

By the way, if you want to switch between branches click on the "active branch" view, and click on the branch you want to make edits in!

## How to make a commit and push to GitHub
After you have made some changes to your project files, do the following to commit and push to GitHub.

Steps:
- Input commit message into the text box
- Press the commit button
- Open the menu
- Click "Pull" (Forgetting this step is a BIG bad habit and will bite you HARD one day, get in the habit of pulling before pushing now!!)
- Open the menu
- Click "Push"

I do **NOT** recommend pushing your commit as soon as you make it. This is because if you make a commit and realize there's something wrong with it, you can go menu -> commit -> undo last commit.
Things get messy when your commit is up in the cloud - best to keep things local until you're sure you're safe to upload to GitHub.
